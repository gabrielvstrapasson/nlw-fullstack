- In the project I studied HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT. It was very good for my learning as I am new to software development.

- The project has several functions, for example: filling out email, telephone to confirm registration for the ‚Äúevent‚Äù, after confirmation go to the next page. The next page has a link to invite other people to the event and add user invitations according to the referenced link
